  We know it’s been a heavy couple of days for the collective and wanted to reach out and let you know we’re still here, committed to packing your orders and highlighting the importance of self care in times like these. 
  <br><br>
  For now, our processing times remain unimpacted. We are heightening our cleaning practices, both at our homes and at our warehouse, which we have exclusive use of and do not share with other any other business. 
  ⁣<br><br>
  Now more than ever, it’s crucial to take care of yourselves and your loved ones, especially if they’re elderly or immunocompromised. ⁣
  ⁣<br><br>
  In the days to come we will be posting health tips to share some ideas on how to take care of your vessel on our <a href="https://instagram.com/lifeflowercare/">instagram</a> page. Featuring fun activities you can do that boost the immune system and ground heightened emotions during this time of chaos.
