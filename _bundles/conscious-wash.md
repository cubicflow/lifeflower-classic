  All three of our best selling, plant-based body washes at a great value.
  Scented with therapeutic grade essential oils of Lavender, Lemongrass and
  Patchouli x Rose, we refer to these body washes as Conscious Wash because
  there’s absolutely no chemicals or harsh ingredients used in the formula
  making it biodegradable and non-toxic, meaning it’s a better, more conscious
  decision for the vital wellbeing of both your body and environment. 


  Each body wash comes with a corresponding cleansed and charged crystal mined
  sustainably from the earth.
