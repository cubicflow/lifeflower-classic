healing-properties: >-
  Intended by Traditional Chinese Medicine to address stagnant energy (chi) in the body, Gua Sha is an essential 2000+ year old healing, self-care technique that can be used both on body and face.
  <br><br>
  It consists of repeated, firm strokes away from the face/down towards the heart over oiled skin with a smooth edged tool like the one pictured. This motion breaks up stagnation in our lymphatic system (LS) - responsible for aiding the body in the removal of toxins and waste. Our LS is twice the size of our circulatory system, yet it has no pump to cleanse it like the heart does for the circulatory system. The movement of lymph relies solely on diet, lifestyle and massage which is why it easily gets stagnant, leading to inflammation and other dis-ease in the body.
  <br><br>
  Facial Gua Sha treatment is dubbed ‘Eastern Botox’ because it actually smoothes out lines/wrinkles, tones muscles, and increases collagen and elasticity in the skin. Since it moves stagnant lymphatic fluid that gets built up, it also carries away toxins and debris that can contribute to acne-prone skin.
