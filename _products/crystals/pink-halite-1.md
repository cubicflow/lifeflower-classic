long_description: This Halite was mined locally (and ethically!) in Torna, CA. Impressive Hopper growth patterns form interesting little cubes all over the piece that are both eye-catching and mind blowing. Starting with a deep pink color at the bottom fading into baby pink and eventually white at the top, this piece is perfect for any part of the home.

healing-properties: Halite is a rock salt known for itâ€™s cleansing and purifying properties, it aids in clarifying energy blocks and balancing energy fields. This makes it perfect for cleansing your other crystals! Similar to Selenite, you can rest your other crystals on it to remove unwanted/negative energies. In meditation, Pink Halite connects to the heart and solar plexus chakras allowing a self-loving awareness which aids in the release of emotional issues and attachments.
