history: Prized in the ancient world for its powers of physical beautification, facial masks of Rose Quartz have been recovered from Egyptian tombs, thought by the Egyptians and Romans to clear the complexion and prevent wrinkles. It was also a stone honoured by the Tibetan and Oriental cultures, and continues to be one of the major carving stones of China.

healing-properties: The fair and lovely Rose Quartz is a stone of the heart, the crystal of unconditional love. It carries a soft feminine energy of compassion, peace, tenderness, healing, nourishment and comfort. It speaks directly to the Heart Chakra, dissolving emotional wounds, fears and resentments, and circulates a Divine loving energy throughout the entire aura. Reawakening the heart to its own innate love, it provides a deep sense of personal fulfillment and contentment, allowing one the capacity to truly give and receive love from others. The perfect stone for empaths or those struggling with letting go emotional trauma.
