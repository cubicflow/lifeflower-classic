product-notes: blank

history: Throughout history the special virtue of Amethyst has been that of preventing drunkenness and overindulgence. Ancient Greeks and Romans routinely studded their goblets with Amethyst believing wine drunk from an Amethyst cup was powerless to intoxicate, and a stone worn on the body, especially at the navel, had a sobering effect, not only for inebriation but in over-zealousness in passion. Catholic bishops also wore Amethyst in a ring to protect from mystical intoxication. Kissing the ring kept others from similar mystical intoxication and kept them grounded in spiritual thought.

healing-properties: Amethyst is a powerful healing and protection stone. It is the February birthstone and is associated to the crown chakra, providing protection against psychic attack, enhancing psychic abilities, calming and stimulating the mind, and nourishing the spirit. For this reason amethyst has been historically used as a remedy for nightmares and insomnia, as well as to aid meditative focus.
