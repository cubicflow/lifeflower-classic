long_description: This Halite was mined locally (and ethically!) in Torna, CA. There is so much to this piece! Boasting a sharp, Hopper growth pattern with intense growth lines and immense detail. It has beautiful deep hues of pink that fade into baby pink and eventually white at the top. Huge and eye-catching, this is a perfect shelf/centre piece.

product-notes: This is an extremely fragile specimen, we will do my best to package it as safely as possible but please be aware some little pieces may break off in transit.

history: blank

healing-properties: Halite is a rock salt known for itâ€™s cleansing and purifying properties, it aids in clarifying energy blocks and balancing energy fields. This makes it perfect for cleansing your other crystals! Similar to Selenite, you can rest your other crystals on it to remove unwanted/negative energies. In meditation, Pink Halite connects to the heart and solar plexus chakras allowing a self-loving awareness which aids in the release of emotional issues and attachments.
