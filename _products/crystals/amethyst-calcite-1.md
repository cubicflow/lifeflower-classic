long_description: This piece is very unique. Featuring countless lilac, pale-purple points with unique growth lines and little calcite growths both inside + on the crystal. It boasts an interesting self-healed side which means the crystal literally healed itself from damage at some point. A great book divider or altar piece.

history: The name Amethyst derives from the Greek word ametusthos, meaning “not intoxicated,” and comes from an ancient legend. The wine god Bacchus, angry over an insult and determined to avenge himself decreed the first person he should meet would be devoured by his tigers. The unfortunate mortal happened to be a beautiful maiden named Amethyst on her way to worship at the shrine of Diana. As the ferocious beasts sprang, she sought the protection of the goddess and was saved by being turned into a clear, white crystal. Bacchus, regretting his cruelty, poured the juice of his grapes over the stone as an offering, giving the gem its lovely purple hue.

healing-properties: Amethyst is a powerful healing and protection stone. It is the February birthstone and is associated to the crown chakra, providing protection against psychic attack, enhancing psychic abilities, calming and stimulating the mind, and nourishing the spirit. For this reason amethyst has been historically used as a remedy for nightmares and insomnia, as well as to aid meditative focus.
