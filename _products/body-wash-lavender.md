  It’s no secret that our skin is our largest organ. Covering our whole body, it is our primary line of defense against illness and dis-ease which can be a big job in today’s society. The vast majority of soap on store shelves is full of synthetics - chemical colors, fragrances/perfumes, foaming boasters, detergents and metals which can all be extremely damaging once rubbed into our most fragile and absorbent organ. Chronic use of these chemical soaps can cause our skin to store them in fat and even in the brain - leading to buildup of cancers and other illnesses. Not only are these chemicals horrible for us, every time we use them they are washed down our drains and introduced into our environment.
  <br><br>
  That’s what brought us here. Handcrafted with a blend of gentle plant oils that are divinely designed by Mother Nature to work with our fragile skin and eco-system, our conscious wash gives you clean without chemical. Thickened with pure organic Aloe and scented with 3 different anti-viral, locally sourced essential oils.
