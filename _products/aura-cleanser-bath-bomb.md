  The aura is an energetic force that surrounds your entire being. It is a force field that draws in and repels all of the emotion, psychic debris and energy that swims around us. Just like the physical body, the aura may experience and exhibit stress, fatigue, and loss of luminosity. Handcrafted with sage, bergamot, and frankincense essential oils and activated charcoal. Activated charcoal works by pulling toxins and debris from our pores while the invigorating aroma cleanses the spirit, revitalizes the mind, and uplifts the heart. Note - this product contains activated charcoal, so give your tub a little scrub when you're done.

ingredients: 50mg Pure Hemp-Derived CBD, Organic Coconut Oil, Sodium Bicarbonate, Naturally-derived Citric Acid, Corn Starch, Epsom Salt, Organic Herbs, Essential Oils, Plant-based Color, Witch Hazel, Cleansed & Charged Crystal.

product-notes: Life Flower products are made in small batches with all-natural and boutique ingredients. Orders are processed and ship within 14 business days. Please allow additional time for&nbsp;delivery.
