  Everyone is different. At Life Flower we not only understand that, we celebrate it. With our 99% pure, non-GMO, organic hemp-derived CBD isolate, you can now infuse your own edibles, tinctures, beverages or wellness products at home with your own standard dose of CBD. Need a little less or a little more? We’ve got you covered. Our CBD isolate is easy to measure and use - making it the perfect addition to your medicine cabinet.
  <br><br>
  CBD Isolate is Cannabidiol in its purest form. The non-psychoactive CBD compound present in full spectrum hemp oil is isolated and refined down to a pristine purity to eliminate oils, toxins, plant material and waxes. With zero taste and odor, CBD blends perfectly in both oil and water bases making it effective and easy to incorporate into daily life. CBD isolate is a completely natural, non-synthetic supplement.
  <br><br>
  Safe, supercritical CO2 is used to pull the CBD-rich hemp oil from the plant, the oil then undergoes purifying processes to filter out the plant material, excess waxes and unwanted, low, THC levels – everything except for organic, pure, crystalline CBD.

  1 gram is 990mg of CBD, so each point on ‘gram’ mode is 99mg. If you’re measuring out with a scale - you’ll want one that measures small weights in milligrams. If buying a scale is too much, you can simply get 10mg measuring spoons online at an affordable price on Amazon.
  <br><br>
  ADD IT TO YOUR FAVORITES: Measure out some CBD for your morning coffee, smoothie, yogurt, oatmeal or tea. The perfect way to start the day. Note that CBD has a boiling point of 160-180 °C (320-356°F), if you cook with CBD at temperatures higher than these you may lose some potency and medicinal value.
  <br><br>
  PUT IT UNDER YOUR TONGUE: Place a small amount of Life Flower CBD Isolate under your tongue and let it sit for at least a minute. It will absorb into the bloodstream and bind with the many CBD receptors in your body, providing fast acting relief and reparation.
  <br><br>
  INHALE CBD: The fastest way to deliver our pure CBD to your receptors is inhalation, this is because the compounds in the CBD bypass the liver and gut and gets delivered directly to the bloodstream for faster effects. Our pure CBD can be added to cannabis or smoked via vape or water bubblers with a vaporization point of 180-200°C (356-392°F).
