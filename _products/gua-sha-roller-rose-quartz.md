long_description: The Rose Quartz Roller is a divine beauty tool for anyone looking to expand their self-love/care routine. Facial rolling is extremely relaxing and has been a beauty ritual since ancient times - dating back to the 7th century in China. The Rose Quartz Roller will help firm the look of skin through gentle massage while supporting the lymphatic system, the body’s biggest detoxification system. Since this tool is made out of Rose Quartz crystal, it works directly with the Heart Chakra to intensify vibrations of unconditional self love.

directions: Best paired with our Unify massage oil - use a few drops on the face and roll gently into the skin. Place it in the fridge or freezer to support natural collagen production and circulation, drain congested lymph nodes and rid the body of toxins.

history: blank

healing-properties: >-
  Intended by Traditional Chinese Medicine to address stagnant energy (chi) in the body, Gua Sha is an essential 2000+ year old healing, self-care technique that can be used both on body and face.
  <br><br>
  It consists of repeated, firm strokes away from the face/down towards the heart over oiled skin with a smooth edged tool like the one pictured. This motion breaks up stagnation in our lymphatic system (LS) - responsible for aiding the body in the removal of toxins and waste. Our LS is twice the size of our circulatory system, yet it has no pump to cleanse it like the heart does for the circulatory system. The movement of lymph relies solely on diet, lifestyle and massage which is why it easily gets stagnant, leading to inflammation and other dis-ease in the body.
  <br><br>
  Facial Gua Sha treatment is dubbed ‘Eastern Botox’ because it actually smoothes out lines/wrinkles, tones muscles, and increases collagen and elasticity in the skin. Since it moves stagnant lymphatic fluid that gets built up, it also carries away toxins and debris that can contribute to acne-prone skin.
